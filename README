This project replicates notebook from cs100.1x Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark

The notbooks are created using a Spark Notebook
Get the Spark Notebook from here: https://github.com/andypetrella/spark-notebook

One way of installing the notebook app is:
1. Make sure you have git and sbt installed.

2. If these are not installed I recommend 'homebrew' as a Mac package manager.

3. Run this:
git clone https://github.com/andypetrella/spark-notebook.git
cd spark-notebook

4. Launch sbt console by running sbt from the spark-notebook folder.

5. After sbt does its magic you should end up with [spark-notebook] prompt now type run.

6. Head to this place pew pew i.e. in your favourite browser open localhost:9000.

7. Load the notebook and play.
